    "## Insights based on your EDA plots:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. BMI is strongly correlated with disease progression:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The scatter plot of BMI vs. target (disease progression) shows a clear positive trend, indicating that higher BMI values are associated with increased disease progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The correlation matrix confirms this with a strong correlation coefficient of 0.59 between BMI and the target variable — one of the highest correlations observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Other significant features include S5 and BP:\n",
    "\n",
    "    S5 shows a strong positive correlation (0.57) with the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Blood Pressure (bp) also shows a moderate positive correlation (0.44), suggesting it’s a relevant predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Feature distributions are standardized and mostly symmetric:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Most features like age, bmi, bp, and s1–s6 are centered around 0 due to standardization, with fairly normal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The target variable (disease progression) is right-skewed, indicating more cases with lower progression values and fewer extreme progression cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Some features are highly correlated with each other:\n",
    "\n",
    "    S1 and S2 (both likely related to cholesterol or serum levels) have a very strong positive correlation (0.9), indicating multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "    S3 and S4 are negatively correlated (-0.74), which may impact model interpretation."
